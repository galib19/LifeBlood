# LifeBlood 

An android app for simplifying blood donation system. It is an GPS based blood donor finder android app which sorts out nearer blood donors across the map. In addition, a user rating system and profiling of donors are being implemented. This system includes the following:

### Registration
A new user can sign up by giving the following information: username, password, name, age, mobile number, address and blood group. System check whether the username is unique. After successful registration a new profile will be created. By default, a user is a receiver as well as a donor who can make request for blood. She can also become only a blood receiver by activating it after registration.

### Authentication

### Receiver
Receiver is one who receives blood from donor. S/he can make a blood request of urgent blood. S/he can also acknowledge some specific issues like hospital name, request details and blood group via that request. This request will search through the customized map to sort out nearer donors of that desired blood group. This list is sorted according to distance. Then it shows all the neared donor list and markers on map. Receiver will then connect to any specific donor via phone call.
